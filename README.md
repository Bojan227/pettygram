# Instagram Clone

Welcome to my Instagram Clone project! In this project, I utilized the power of React and Typescript for the frontend, as well as Express and Typescript for the backend. I also integrated Cloudinary, a cloud-based image and video management solution, for storing and serving images.

The frontend of the application is built using React. With Typescript, I was able to add static typing to my code, improving code quality and reducing bugs. The UI of the application is designed to look and feel like the original Instagram application, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with the platform.

For the backend, I chose Express, a popular Node.js framework for building web applications. With Typescript, I was able to add type-checking to my code, making it more robust and maintainable. The backend is responsible for handling user authentication, image uploads, and other server-side operations that power the Instagram clone.

To store and serve images, I used Cloudinary, a cloud-based image and video management solution. Cloudinary makes it easy to upload, store, and serve images, as well as manipulate them using a variety of built-in features. This allowed me to focus on building the core functionality of the Instagram clone, while letting Cloudinary handle the heavy lifting of image management.

Overall, this Instagram clone project showcases my skills in building full-stack web applications using modern technologies like React, Typescript, and Express, as well as integrating with third-party services like Cloudinary.
