Welcome to Pettygram, the social media platform for pets! In this project, I utilized React and Typescript for the frontend, as well as Express and Typescript for the backend. I also integrated Cloudinary, a cloud-based image and video management solution, for storing and serving images.

The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. With Typescript, I was able to add static typing to my code, improving code quality and reducing bugs. The UI of the application is designed to be pet-friendly, with fun and playful designs that cater to the interests of pet owners.

For the backend, I chose Express, a popular Node.js framework for building web applications. With Typescript, I was able to add type-checking to my code, making it more robust and maintainable. The backend is responsible for handling user authentication, image uploads, and other server-side operations that power the Pettygram application.

To store and serve images, I used Cloudinary, a cloud-based image and video management solution. Cloudinary makes it easy to upload, store, and serve images, as well as manipulate them using a variety of built-in features. This allowed me to focus on building the core functionality of the Pettygram application, while letting Cloudinary handle the heavy lifting of image management.

Pettygram is the perfect platform for pet owners to share photos of their furry friends, connect with other pet owners, and discover new pets. The application is designed to be easy to use and accessible to everyone. With Pettygram, you can create a profile for your pet, post photos, comment on other posts, and follow other pets.

Overall, this project showcases my skills in building full-stack web applications using modern technologies like React, Typescript, and Express, as well as integrating with third-party services like Cloudinary. If you're a pet owner looking for a fun and engaging way to share photos of your pets, Pettygram is the perfect platform for you!
